				Digital businesses seek to maximize the value of data through superior data sharing and business system integration, among other goals. The cloud is an essential vehicle in that quest. For many applications and data, starting fresh in the cloud or moving data to the cloud is the right approach. But for some applications and data — like the types that keep your CEO and CFO out of jail — a better option is emerging.

		<h2>The Utter Pain Of Complex Application Migration</h2>
		<section class="article">
			<p>All businesses evolve in response to market opportunities, technology evolution, competitor moves, management biases and regulatory environments. A company’s business systems typically reflect a business’s path through its competitive landscape over time. Many businesses are still living with the right business system decisions made decades ago. In some cases, older applications and the data they control limit a business’s digital transformation options.
			<br>

			To recover those options, many management teams are under pressure to get “to the cloud.” But there are multiple paths to get there. You can:
			<br>
			<ol>
				<li>Find a substitute SaaS application and migrate whole business functions to the new application.</li>
				<li>Convert the application to a more public cloud-native form and migrate the application, its data, and the application operations to the cloud.</li>
				<li>Virtualize the applications — essentially by removing hardware-related dependencies in the application — and slide it to an instance of that virtualized environment in the cloud.</li>
				<li>Choose infrastructure technologies that provide application and data compatibility but also bring the cloud to your application and data.</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			<p>

			Different classes of business systems benefit from different approaches. For example, moving sales and marketing functions to Saleforce, a leading SaaS provider, proved the right approach for many businesses that tried but failed to implement sales automation systems on-premise.

			But some applications don’t have SaaS substitutes, are very difficult to convert, and demand specific classes of infrastructure support that are difficult to virtualize. No business should throw millions of dollars at an effort to migrate an application to the cloud, only to get nearly the same function while dramatically increasing operational risk, without giving serious consideration to all options.
