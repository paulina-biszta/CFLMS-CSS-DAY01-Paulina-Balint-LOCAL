          London is considered to be one of the world's most important global
          cities and has been called the world's most powerful, most desirable,
          most influential, most visited, most expensive, sustainable, most
          investment-friendly, and most-popular-for-work city. London exerts a
          considerable impact upon the arts, commerce, education, entertainment,
          fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research
          and development, tourism and transportation. London ranks 26th out of
          300 major cities for economic performance. It is one of the largest
          financial centres and has either the fifth or the sixth largest
          metropolitan area GDP. It is the most-visited city as measured by
          international arrivals and has the busiest city airport system as
          measured by passenger traffic. It is the leading investment
          destination, hosting more international retailers and ultra
          high-net-worth individuals than any other city. London's universities
          form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in
          Europe, and London is home to highly ranked institutions such as
          Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, the London
          School of Economics in social sciences, and the comprehensive
          University College London and King's College London. In 2012, London
          became the first city to have hosted three modern Summer Olympic
          Games.
